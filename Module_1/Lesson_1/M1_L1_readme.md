## Overview

What does "open science" mean? In this lesson, you will take a closer look at the definition of open science, including the intended goals and outcomes of adopting open science as an individual and as part of a larger community. You'll then review the different components of science and the pillars that make them up, followed by examples of open science in action, such as a case study on citizen science research. Finally, you will wrap up the lesson by taking a closer look at why the adoption of open science is needed in the scientific world today.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain the beneficial reasons to do open science, as well as its the goals.
- Define "open science".
- List different groups that practice open science.

## Motivation for Open Science

Welcome to the first module of NASA's Open Science 101 curriculum! Module 1 has five lessons that present information about the Ethos of Open Science. This incorporates the motivations and best practices for making science more open, as well as multiple examples of successful applications of open science. This course was made possible thanks to the work of our NASA Open Science team, open science Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and a community of contributors (3,100+)!

We are really glad you are here!

This is the first lesson in the module on the Ethos of Open Science. Let's begin by explaining the word "ethos".

<img src="../images/media/merriamwebster.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto;">

"Ethos is the distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person, group,"

This section will describe and showcase what makes open science - as an approach to knowledge production - unique and distinguishable from other scientific approaches.

Note that "ethos" is not exactly "ethics," but offers a broad enough term to include the moral attitudes held by the individuals or institutions who practice open science. To clarify the moral element to this discussion, we'll speak of "responsible open science" going forward.

Throughout the rest of this module, we have integrated the ethics around open science that dictate how you share data, give due credit, and work together. These ethical principles encourage you to "practice the golden rule" by treating others the way you would like to be treated in their situation.

You'll build upon the work of others from across the globe and fields of research who paved the way to open science. Their recognition of open science as a necessary tool to share knowledge and catalyze research has inspired NASA's own pursuit to contribute. Best practices, performance indicators, and core principles established by the global open science community inform our current approach.

### Open Science at NASA

NASA funds some of the most diverse research of any federal agency and has a history of sharing research and results, going back to the early space science missions in the 1960's. In particular, NASA's Open Science 101 curriculum shares guidelines and best practices for open science that are applicable and beneficial across its entire range of research efforts.

By funding a variety of research activities, from basic science to applied engineering, NASA datasets cover a range of topics. These include biology, chemistry, environmental science, geology, and other fields related to robotic and human planetary exploration, stellar evolution, and the search for extraterrestrial life.

<img src="../images/media/image238.png" style="width: 350px; height: auto;" />

The open science practices and principles that play a critical role in supporting NASA mission successes are equally relevant to other government agencies and institutions. Similar considerations, approaches, and behaviors are needed in a variety of scientific contexts. Tools for open science frameworks and workflows follow generally similar models.

Open science practices and principles can be applied to all stages of the research process. One early example of NASA's efforts to involve more people in science is the [exoplanet citizen science projects](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/citizen-science/), with the [Exoplanet Explorers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers) (external link) being a significant part of this effort.

<img src="../images/media/image266.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />

"Stargazing Live," a live television program, took place across three consecutive nights in 2017. The hosts invited viewers to identify exoplanets in an open access dataset. Within 48 hours of the program's debut, more than 10,000 people had participated in [Exoplanet Explorers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers) (external link) and classified over 2 million systems.

Following the first night of the program, the researchers watched the results roll in, as citizen scientists helped sift through the data. On the second night, enough people had participated that the researchers were able to share that 44 Jupiter-size candidate planets, 72 Neptune-size candidate planets, 53 sub-Neptune size candidate planets (larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune), and 44 Earth-size candidate planets had already been found and were undergoing additional analysis.

Communities, working together on a problem, can rapidly find new results! Open science enables this and more.

### The Internet Facilitates Sharing of Information

Historically, factors like time, access to sufficient tools and data, and physical proximity limited who could be involved in science, as well as how easily collaboration could take place within the scientific community. More recently, digital resources like the internet have increased participation by eliminating barriers to entry and presenting a platform for digital collaboration on a global scale. The internet offered people access to the appropriate infrastructure to conduct open science, while the practices of open science enabled more people to engage with research products. Unfortunately, challenges remain for people who don't have the right computational tools and/or speak the relevant languages.

The internet creates many outlets for public-hosting and free access to research and data. These outlets, combined with advances in computational power, enable nearly anyone to perform complex data analysis. It is now possible to connect participants, stakeholders, and outputs of open science on the internet to make scientific processes and products easier to discover and access.

### Why Should We Do Open Science Now?

The practice of open science increases transparency of the scientific process by allowing for validation of results, combating misinformation by making results available to the public.

**Reproduce Results**

Science becomes more robust and accurate when scientists validate their colleagues' results. However, the rapidly-growing pool of published research presents an overwhelming challenge to reproduce:

- In 2011, the AAAS, publisher of Science, began requiring the authors of computational research reports to share data and software upon request.
- In 2018, a [research study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115) was carried out that investigated 204 articles for reproducibility and that were published in the journal *Science* between 2011 and 2018. It was found that only 26% of papers were able to be reproduced, with the two primary reasons being the inability to get access to the data and software and the fact that the methods were not described in sufficient detail.

**How many studies were reproduced?**

[IMG: [no-yes.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tk2V-ygMTKThjmK6YcKIRtS9C5YZkbVU/view?usp=drive_link)]

**Open Results Enable Iteration and Improve Error-Detection**

In this section, we will look at an example provided by Gilet (n.d.) [following the outcome](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1318&context=usdeptcommercepub) of how closed science can restrict research impact. Science can majorly inform a field's state of research, the decisions of policymakers, and the actions of society.

Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann were electrochemists at the University of Utah who collaborated on a cold fusion research project in the 1980's. The team built a “fusion cell,” consisting of a palladium rod and a platinum rod submerged in heavy water. Heavy water consists of a water (H2O) molecule in which the hydrogen atoms have been replaced with deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium contains one neutron, one proton, and one electron; elemental hydrogen contains only a proton and electron. Pons and Fleischmann theorized that if they caused the heavy water molecules to split by employing an electrolysis process, the released deuterium would be absorbed into the palladium rods, the deuterium atoms would fuse together, and a tremendous amount of energy, in the form of heat, would be released. The experiment was conducted, and the team measured the heat produced to be a magnitude of 100 times more than could be attributed to typical chemical processes. Excited by the potential of discovering an inexpensive and accessible source of energy, Pons and Fleischmann sought additional funding to continue their research. With promising results in hand, they applied for government grants.

[IMG: [Fussion-Cell1L1.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VskYENiyRbfriozcnMDqX6qvNoUJrRCG/view?usp=drive_link)]

One reviewer, a nuclear physicist named Steven Jones who was also working on cold fusion, suggested the possibility of a collaboration between their two teams. However, Pons and Fleischmann, believing their experiment to be the key to unlocking cold fusion, declined the offer, unintentionally creating an unofficial race between the two groups to be the first to publish their findings. Encouraged and supported by their institutions to publish rapidly in fear of being scooped, the researchers bypassed the traditional standards of scientific conduct, and did not sufficiently expose their ideas for testing and analysis. Pons and Fleischman, orchestrated by their institution, organized a press conference to announce the success of their cold fusion experiment. The press conference was hosted prior to the publication of their paper, which would have allowed other researchers to evaluate and replicate their results and establish greater creditability for the experiment. The details of their experiment were kept vague, leaving other researchers in the dark about crucial elements of their design.

Unauthorized copies of their paper began to circulate within the scientific community and attempts to replicate the experiment all resulted in failure. Researchers quickly realized that the paper lacked key information necessary for replication. Over time, few groups found any support for the cold fusion hypothesis, and the results from those who did were inconsistent and unreliable. Pons and Fleischmann's lack of reproducibility indicated that the process for cold fusion had most likely not been discovered.

The scientific community norms in place at the time did not include the open sharing of data and code. This was, in part, because it allowed researchers to keep a competitive advantage when seeking funding opportunities. The practice of withholding code, data, and other research products can stifle scientific progress. In the cold fusion example, a flawed study could have swiftly been corrected by peer feedback, but instead, this “discovery” undermined the credibility of the scientific community. Their failure to be transparent with their findings cost taxpayers upwards of $100 million and dealt a significant blow to the public's trust in scientific research. It is imperative to shift the entire science ecosystem, policies, and rewards towards the prioritization of openness if the full and immediate benefits of research are to be realized.

**Traditional Publishing Limits Participation**

Historically, scientific publishers have charged subscription fees to access journals and, often, article processing charges (APCs) to cover the costs of preparing a manuscript for press (even when the peer reviewers were volunteering their time). These practices limit both who could read papers and who could publish results.

Open access publishing has significantly increased the number of articles that are available as electronic copies online. A growing number of governments and funding agencies are starting to mandate that research funded by taxpayers must be accessible to the public after publication. However, the current hybrid system still does a poor job of allocating costs fairly across the research publication process (more on this in Module 5).

The issue of limited access to published papers also motivates open science. According to [Nair-Bedouelle (n.d.)](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/can-science-be-more-equitable-so-everyone-enjoys-benefits-open-science-answer), and as shown on the below charts, even though more climate research is made available as open access than that from other scientific fields, the majority of research articles, including many important ones, remain behind paywalls. Misinformation is freely available to anyone online but scientific results are mostly hidden from the public behind paywalls. This practice does not increase trust in science.

## What is Open Science?

But what is "open science" exactly? Various definitions for open science exist and are in use by different organizations, but all have a central theme. For the purposes of this course, we will use a definition for open science that was developed in 2021 by scientists working for the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/).

[IMG: [OS1L1embeddedhtml.png]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZSxGOwLa_t5sUsx0wwEGa0M6yVbdlaa/view?usp=drive_link])] (alt:"Open Science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity."-Ramachandran et al., 2021)

This definition was derived after reviewing numerous open science definitions from agencies, institutions, and organizations around the world. Many of the existing definitions had changed over time as the collective understanding of open science matured and became more nuanced. Let's break down the definition a bit more:

- Research products and processes should be available to all, not just a small subset of experts, particularly if funded with public funds.
- Collaboration is the heart of open science. Researchers with different areas of expertise and backgrounds can bring new perspectives and strategies to the project.
- Advancing technology has changed the way we share results. These advances can be harnessed to enable greater collaboration, increase distribution and exposure for the research products, and accelerate the pace of new discoveries.
- While open science is our aim, security and privacy remain important concerns. Therefore, select sensitive information should be protected.

Open science is a culture intended to promote science and its social impact. By creating new opportunities for different stakeholders including researchers, policymakers, and public participants, open science increases study transparency, repeatability, reproducibility, and confirmation. We expand what these terms mean and why they matter throughout this module and later in the other Open Science 101 modules.


### How Do You Do Open Science?

The "Ethos of Open Science" is a broad term that encompasses the moral and ethical attitudes held by individuals and institutions about practicing "open" science. There is an ethical element to sharing both new knowledge and the processes used to obtain said knowledge. It is important to note that there is no singular way of practicing or conducting open science.

Differing practices, assumptions, and goals are just part of the complexity of open science. There are also divergent moral principles that guide open science communities. Such principles are captured in "codes of conduct." A code of conduct is a community governance mechanism that outlines the principles and practices expected of a given research community's members, as well as the process for investigating and reprimanding those in violation of the code.

In a sense, a code of conduct constitutes the moral backbone of a research community. However, as with the numerous schools of thought, there are similarly many codes of conduct. In other words, there is no one set of universal principles that all open science practitioners abide by. For example, consider how [OLS](https://openlifesci.org/code-of-conduct) (external link), [INOSC](https://osf.io/6gsye) (external link), [allea](https://osf.io/6gsye) (external link), [AGU](https://www.agu.org/Plan-for-a-Meeting/AGUMeetings/Meetings-Resources/Meetings-code-of-conduct) (external link) and [Ethical Source](https://www.agu.org/Plan-for-a-Meeting/AGUMeetings/Meetings-Resources/Meetings-code-of-conduct) (external link) all have different codes of conducts and guiding principles.

The goal of NASA's Open Science 101 is to push the community as a whole towards open science as an ethical responsibility to share knowledge.

| Ethics | Morals |
|---|---|
| Community consensus about "proper" behavior. | Personal set of standards for "good" behavior. |

<img src="../images/media/image258.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />

You may or may not have heard the term "Open Science" used before this course. If you have, you likely have some preconception of open science and what it looks like in practice. Let’s collectively look at those various conceptions.

### Activity 1.1: Think About the What and How of Open Science

In this activity, reflect on your answers to the questions and then compare your thoughts to the key takeaways.

<img style="width:350px;height:auto;" src="../images/media/lightbulb.png">

- What does the act of open science look like? Does a researcher use or create something specific that would characterize their research as open? What comes to your mind?
- Describe how you currently share your materials (data, code, results).
- How might you share materials in the future more openly?
- What stands in the way?

**Key Takeaways:**

There are many ways to do open science. One of the best ways to start your open science journey is to think about how you do your science and how you might be able to make your science more open.

**Goals of Open Science**

The nuances of implementing open science take time and experience to develop. This curriculum provides practical steps and insightful examples to make open science happen.

Goals of open science include: 

- Facilitating collective benefit.
- Expediting development and innovation.
- Realizing unbiased outcomes.
- Ensuring appropriate control over the data you use, make, or share throughout your research process, and comply with policy, regulatory, and legal guidance on release.
- Nurturing respectful relationships with the external communities who might provide or interact with your data, code, and results.
- Actively engaging with interested scientific and public communities to increase collabortation and consultation throughout your research efforts. Members of communities that provide data must be allowed to determine the benefits, harms, and potential future uses based on their own values and priorities.

### Fostering Collaborations and Reproducibility

[IMG: [OSgivescredit1L1.png]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UrI3-FgK2pmDmXjCTQd_remYKWlJ8NPb/view?usp=drive_link])]

Openly using, making, and sharing research analyses, code, or datasets ensures that everyone receives credit for their work.

Sharing is grounded in the belief that access to information and the ability to collaborate is essential for advancing scientific understanding and solving complex problems.

Open sharing enables greater transparency in the scientific process and facilitates reproducibility. By enabling collaboration, open sharing includes additional perspectives and expertise and makes scientific knowledge more openly available to the public.

Not only does open sharing help society, but it also can benefit each of us as individual researchers by leading to greater visibility, impact, and credit of our results, data, and code. It can even provide access to new collaborations and ideas, and it can fulfill ethical and social responsibilities.

### Key Takeaways: Deﬁnition of Open Science

Open science is multi-faceted and can mean different things to different people. Some researchers may think of open science as open access publications or as citizen science. In this module and more broadly in this curriculum, we make it clear that open science encompasses all of these various aspects. Right now, you may be more comfortable with some aspects of open science than others - and that's OK! We hope that you will better understand the scope and nuances of open science by the end of this curriculum, and also understand the benefits of doing open science, as we have begun to discuss in this section. Specifically, the increasing amount of information about scientific processes and products available online enables access for a much wider array of individuals and communities to use, make, and share scientific research and results.

## Who Does Open Science?

Open science doesn't only involve researchers; many other stakeholders are affected by the outcomes of open science. Stakeholders include any individuals who can affect or be affected by open science projects.

[IMG:[researchers1L1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13smkx5wJhQu8ezn5CgqVAuyTvTuvMtiI/view?usp=drive_link)]

Scientific research should benefit humanity. Although open science has many stakeholders, the advantageous interactions between science and society take place among three core groups: scientific researchers, policymakers, and the public. Researchers do science and share their results with policymakers and the general public to inform their decisions and improve their lives. The public helps to fund research through taxes and can provide input to future areas of study. Policymakers help to implement measures that are informed by scientific results to improve the health, environment, and livability of society.

These three stakeholder groups remain central to the world of open science. However, open science encourages participation from the broader public. The growth of public participation in science can occur by removing barriers, such as paywalls, and by expanding the community of people who support the scientific research itself.

Here we list some core groups who we envision as taking part in and/or benefitting from open science, while being fully aware that this list is not exhaustive and the categories we choose here have very blurred boundaries.

The public can also take part in open science through community science projects (e.g. as volunteers to collect or manage data). As a result, participants boost their understanding of science and feel empowered through opportunities to exert influence.</p>

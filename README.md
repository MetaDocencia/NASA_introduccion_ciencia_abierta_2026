## Curriculum Overview

NASA's Open Science training is a NASA initiative designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities into a collaborative culture of open science. Developed by the NASA Open Science team, the guidance provided by the Open Science 101 curriculum will promote the transformation of the research landscape and the accompanying advancement of scientific discovery. The Open Science 101 curriculum aims to introduce learners to a nuanced understanding of open science, enabling participants to better understand an open science workflow from end to end. The focus of the curriculum is to provide learners with a basic understanding of how to share and publish research in an open but responsible way to maximize the scientific and economic impact from research, enabling future researchers to build from shared work. NASA Open Science 101 will also be used to support researchers looking to engage with NASA as it moves to adopt more open science requirements. Scientists will need to acquire the new skills highlighted in the curriculum to participate in open science effectively and to demonstrate those skills when applying for NASA funding opportunities.

A NASA Open Science digital badge is earned by completing all five modules and passing the assessment at the end of each module.}

## Join the Open Science Community

Throughout this course, we will provide information about how you can become aware of open science opportunities and be more involved in the open science community. An easy way to get started is to subscribe to the free NASA Open Science newsletter. Our monthly newsletter not only highlights our ongoing open science efforts, but also keeps you informed about the latest tools and resources designed to empower scientists and researchers to more effectively engage with NASA's vast amount of science data. Upcoming highlights include insights into cutting-edge AI tools, the continued development of dynamic search engines like the Science Discovery Engine, and much more.
